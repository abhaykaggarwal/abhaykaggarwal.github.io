                    <p><b>Released:</b> 1997</p>
                    <p><b>Synopsis:</b> This film follows Prince Ashitaka as he aims to bring balance between humans and the forest. He meets San, a human girl raised by wolves who fights against Lady Eboshi, culminating in an epic war...</p>
                    <p class="appear title san"> <b>San</b></p>
                    <p class="appear san">San is the titular character of this film. A fierce and fearless warrior, she will fight to the death to protect the forest against the human invaders. Her love for the forest comes against Lady Eboshiâ€™s love for her people.</p>
                    <p class="appear title eboshi"><b>Lady Eboshi</b></p>
                    <p class="appear eboshi">Lady Eboshi is the charismatic leader of the humans who use the forest to fuel their growing cities. A cunning and caring leader, she is initially unsympathetic due to her war on the forest, but we learn that she does this to support her people, regardless of the consequences.</p>
                    <p class="appear title forest"><b>Forest Spirit</b></p>
                    <p class="appear forest">Possibly the most important character in the film, the Forest Spirit represents the forest. Its head is rumored to give immortality, and as such Lady Eboshi hopes to give it to the Emperor, although in the end the Spirit regrows the entire forest.</p>
